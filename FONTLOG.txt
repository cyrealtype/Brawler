FONTLOG for the Brawler font

This file provides detailed information on the Brawler font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Brawler fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Brawler is a compact typeface with sharp features and a sturdy character, designed for comfortable reading in small sizes. It was initially planned as a typeface for newspapers and tabloids. Thus, the design concept was shaped by the demands of low quality printing media and the aesthetic preferences of periodical publications.


Brawler is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1
